# Backup of original classifier.py - see classifier.py for the rewritten version
# Original approach used Atlas v2 API to create entities and classifications directly.
# New approach uses the Purview Scanning Data Plane API for classification rules,
# scan rule sets, and scan triggers to classify existing assets.
